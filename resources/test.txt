Title: "The Button"

Eli found the button on his desk one morning. It hadn’t been there the night before. It was small, red, and surrounded by a note: “Do not press.”

Naturally, he stared at it all day.

He asked his coworkers. No one had seen it. He tried ignoring it. That failed. He even hid it in a drawer—but it reappeared on his desk the next day.

By the third day, he couldn’t take it anymore.

With a deep breath, Eli pressed the button.

Nothing happened.

He laughed. “Figures,” he muttered.

Then his phone buzzed.

Unknown Number: “You pressed it.”

Eli froze. He looked around. The lights dimmed. The office went silent.

The button disappeared.

From that day on, strange things started happening—lost time, repeating days, people acting like they’d never met him. The world had changed, subtly, but undeniably.

And each morning, a new button appeared. Different color. Same note.

"Do not press."

But Eli knew now—he always would.

He would press it again.
